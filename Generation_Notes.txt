(These notes are for my own personal use.)

The idea is to make temporary changes to other projects (unpublished on github).

Generating the main text:
-------------------------
Project: quotations
- ParseAndGenerate.java: location of the quotes.txt file
- GeneratedPdf.java: title
- GeneratedPdf.java: font size large title (reduce from 30 to 20)
- GeneratedPdf.java: last numbered page (changes according to the amount of text)


Generating the cover:
-----------------------
Project: books-anne-of-green-gables
GenerateCover.java
 - OUTPUT_FILE, just hard code it to a temp location
 - SPINE_WIDTH, varies with the number of pages (1.375 changes to 0.75)
 - WIDTH may need adjustment as well (14.06 changes to 13.50)
   You will see error messages returned by lulu.com, if a wrong-sized cover is uploaded!
Settings.java
 - TITLE
 - AUTHOR_FULL_NAME
 - AUTHOR_LAST_NAME
